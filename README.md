Hands-on with GraphQL. Alternative to cloning the repo, there is a Codesandbox link where you can work in the browser: https://tinyurl.com/socrates-gql

Setup dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Run apollo server:

```
yarn start
```

## Goal

Implement the search query resolver to return search result products,
by reading data from the mock `db.js` file.
